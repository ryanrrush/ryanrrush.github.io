<p>
Hi Everyone, my name is Ryan Rush and I'm from Southern California. I have worked in the library coming up on 13 years now and have decided to take the next step in getting my MLIS. I work at Cal Poly Pomona and I have unexpectedly been put in the role to oversee our library technology services department due to vacancies. I think I'm going to stick in the systems realm after I graduate.
<br>
<br>
I'm a bit of a SciFi nerd that likes Star Wars and Star Trek. I like to play open world video games, something that takes me hours and hours to complete. I try to explore every aspect of a game. I also like to do things with my hands like building stuff. I'm currently trying to find some projects for wood working to get into and hopefully get my child involved in as well.
